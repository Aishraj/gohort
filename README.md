Gohort
==================

Gohort  is a simple URL shortner written in Go.

Its design is based out the [Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/742013/how-to-code-a-url-shortener) about writing a URL shortner. It uses [gorilla/mux](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/mux) for routing requests.

===============
I came across the Stack Overflow question last week and was fascinated by the simplicity of the developing a URL shortner. As I'm still quite new to Go, I created this module as a side project. All contributions are welcome.
